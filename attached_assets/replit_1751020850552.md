## Overview

This is a Flask-based Question Answering and Document Processing application that leverages Groq's Llama models and Google Gemini embeddings to provide intelligent responses to user queries. The system supports document upload, processing, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to answer questions based on uploaded content. It also includes translation capabilities using Google Translator and advanced text summarization features with multiple output options.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular Flask architecture with the following key components:

- **Flask Web Application**: Main web server handling HTTP requests and responses
- **Document Processing Module**: Handles TXT, PDF, and DOCX file processing
- **RAG System**: Implements retrieval-augmented generation using OpenAI embeddings
- **Translation Service**: Provides multi-language translation capabilities
- **Session-based Storage**: Uses Flask sessions for temporary data storage
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS/JS with Bootstrap for responsive UI

## Key Components

### Backend Services

1. **Document Processor (`document_processor.py`)**
   - Extracts text from TXT, PDF, and DOCX files
   - Handles multiple file formats with appropriate error handling
   - Uses PyPDF2 for PDF processing and python-docx for DOCX files

2. **RAG System (`rag_system.py`)**
   - Implements document chunking using LangChain's RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
   - Uses Google Gemini's `models/embedding-001` for embeddings
   - Stores documents in FAISS vectorstore for each session
   - Performs similarity search for relevant content retrieval
   - Uses Groq's Llama3-70b-8192 model for question answering and summarization

3. **Translation Service (`translation_service.py`)**
   - Supports 80+ languages including major world languages
   - Uses Google Translator (completely free) for accurate translations
   - Supports both source and target language selection
   - Provides comprehensive language code mapping for user-friendly interface

### Frontend Components

1. **Enhanced Responsive Web Interface**
   - Bootstrap-based responsive design with modern styling
   - Collapsible sidebar navigation that can be hidden/shown
   - Drag-and-drop file upload functionality with progress indicators
   - Real-time chat interface for Q&A with typing indicators
   - Word count tracking for text inputs

2. **Multi-feature Interface**
   - Question Answering System with document upload
   - Advanced Text Summarizer with 3 summary length options (Short/Medium/Detailed)
   - Multi-language Translation tool supporting 80+ languages with source/target selection

## Data Flow

1. **Document Upload**: Users upload documents via drag-and-drop or file browser
2. **Document Processing**: Files are processed and text is extracted
3. **Embedding Generation**: Text is chunked and converted to embeddings
4. **Storage**: Document chunks and embeddings stored in session memory
5. **Query Processing**: User questions are matched against stored embeddings
6. **Response Generation**: Relevant context is used with GPT-4o to generate answers

## External Dependencies
